# SPDCTools
Tools used to calculate spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes in nonlinear optical materials.

This repository contains python code files used to calculate the spectra and emission probability of photon pairs as discussed in the paper "A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures".

All code uses either commonly maintained tools or packages, or the custom packages are self-contained in the repository. 

If you run into any issues, please contact the author. 


BEFORE USING THE CODE:

1. Much of the code requires the path directory to be set to the parent folder of the repository. This can be changed by explicitly setting the home directory in the code. 

2.
